# Trust Track App

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Trust Track App** where we aim to revolutionize the way non-profit projects receive funding. Our mission is to create a more transparent, reliable, and safe system for donations. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we ensure that your contribution is used exactly as intended. No more uncertainty—track your donation and see exactly where your money goes.

## What is [Trust Track App]?

**[Trust Track App]** is a founding platform designed specifically for non-profit projects. We are building a system that offers complete transparency, accountability, and security by using the **APTOS blockchain** to track every transaction. Donations made to any project on our platform will be fully traceable, and a **multisignature system** will ensure that the funds are only used for the project the donor has supported.


### Key Features

- **Transparent transactions:** Using the APTOS blockchain, all donations are tracked and visible on the blockchain, giving you full insight into where your money is going.
- **Multisignature enforcement:** We implement a multisignature mechanism, requiring multiple approvals before any funds are moved. This ensures that donations are spent only on the intended project.
- **Trustworthy & Safe:** Donors can have full confidence that their money will be used ethically and responsibly.

## How It Works

**Choose a Project**: Browse through our list of non-profit projects and find one you believe in.
2. **Donate**: Contribute funds to your chosen project. Every donation is logged and tracked on the APTOS blockchain, providing a transparent record of where the money is going.
3. **Track**: Follow the funds as they are used, ensuring that the project team follows through with their promises.
4. **Multisignature Approval**: Each donation will be divided into milestones, and each milestone will require approval from multiple project team members before the funds are released, preventing misuse and ensuring accountability.
5. **Milestone's system**: A previous milestone needs to be validated by a significant number of donors before proceeding to release the funds for the next milestone, ensuring that the progress meets the expectations of the supporters.
